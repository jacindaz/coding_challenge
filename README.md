## The Challenge:

Create an application available online that allows users to enter search text and a phone number. Your application will send a text message to to that number with a related gif.

We recommend using the Sinatra web application framework, Heroku for hosting, the Twilio API for texting and the Giphy API.

Please use our paid Twilio account, which will allow you to send messages to arbitrary numbers.
